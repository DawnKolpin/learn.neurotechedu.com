## Emotiv Epoc
<hr>

<div class="row">
<div class="large-6 columns" markdown="1">
The Emotiv Epoc is one of the first consumer EEG devices which was released on the market. The popularity of the company surged in 2012 and 2013, which can be reflected by its sales and number of DIY projects.

The Epoc is more stylish and easier to wear. It has 14 channel EEG which has a static form factor. This board is a good option for easy development and it only requires software experience. It is also a popular device to use for EEG research as the cost is much better versus other research grade mobile EEG providers. The major downside of the Epoc is the cost and the fact that they charge you to get access to raw data. Multiple people have complained that the provided electrodes are not very good.
