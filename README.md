## Fundamental changes to default template

The Neurotech EDU logo HTML/CSS was changed for the header type "image_fullwidth". The affected files are "masthead.html", "navigation.html" and "layout.scss". The logo used to be positioned on top of the header image.

If you simply want to change the logo image, that is done from config.yml
