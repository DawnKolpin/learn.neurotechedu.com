NeurotechEDU is an open-source project designed to promote collaboration and user-generated content.
The idea is that if you are not finding something that should be part of our resources you can go ahead and make it and upload it to our page.

The project is built with the help of:

 * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
 * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
 * [Feeling Responsive Jekyll theme](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) by Phlow

Github is necessary if you wish to contribute to NeurotechEDU. [You can learn about Github here.](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)


##Contributing

We have set up the contribution process to be as simple as possible so that people who don’t have much experience programming are still able to contribute.

+ There are two ways to do so:
- By editing a new page directly on Github.
- By cloning this repository, installing jekyll and making the page locally (this option allows for previews).

With either, once done, you push a commit to us and once approved, your content becomes part of the website.

The first option allows you to only use markdown, a very simple syntax designed to accomodate prose in web documents. It does require precise spacing. Elements such as lists might need a blank line before and after the element in order to work properly. You can read more about it here.

###Editing directly on Github
Head to /pages and click on the template file

1. Rename the file to your liking
2. Change the file’s title, teaser and permalink. Make sure to keep the same formatting.
3. The page starts below the masthead markdown code, we have included examples of the code there. YOu can see what it looks like once rendered by jekyll on 

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

### Making a contribution


In order to parcitpate, we have set up the following architecture:

Your contribution should come in the form of a page.
Examplaes include : headsets, getting started.

To start making a page, you can clone the repostiroy:

to be in the for of a new page, under the /pages folder.

```

    /template.md
```

To start, copy the template.md file and start editing in markdown.


## Jekyll Setup for Mac OS and Linux

The website uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator written in Ruby.
You need to have Version 2.0.0 or higher of Ruby and the package manager Bundler.
(The package manager is used to make sure you use exactly the same versions of software as GitHub Pages.)
After checking out the repository, please run:

```
$ bundle install

```

to install Jekyll and the software it depends on.
You may consult [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) for further instructions.

You will also need [Python 3](http://python.org/) with
[PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/) available in order to
re-generate the [data files](#details) the site depends on.

## Jekyll on Windows

Installing Jekyll on Windows is somewhat different. [You can learn about it here.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/)
